# Banking
A program created specifically to showcase a use of Superclasses, overriding methods and the likes. Additionally showing the ability to write in-depth testing scenarios for a program. This program has 3 main classes, "Account" the superclass, tracking only a balance, allowing for Deposits and Withdrawals. It gets extended by "Chequing", which tracks the amount of withdrawals made (with an overridden withdraw method), and having a monthly limit, when the limit is checked, the account is charged for each transaction over the limit they are. It finally gets extended by Savings, which tracks an annual interest rate. The interest rate, when applied, will simply multiply the current balance by 1/12th of itself.
